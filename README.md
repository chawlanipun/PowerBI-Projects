3. There is no state where all 3 type of products are sold.
4. Technology items were not sold in 2018.
5. Technology items are only sold in the 4th and 1st quarter and that too in just 2 states, Nebraska and Texas respectively.
6. If we compare the sales and gross profits of 2017 and 2019, in 2019, though the sales are less, the gross profit is very high.
7. Furniture sales drop sharply in the 3rd quarter.
8. Washington, Texas and Kentucky have sales only in 2017, probably they were shut down.
9. Winsconsin opened in 2018 and maybe closed in that year too.
10. North Carolina opened in 2019.
11. Binders have around quarter of a million sales but the gross profit is $0.
